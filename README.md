# Mortgage-Lending-Decision
Conducted Logit and Probit Regression analysis to examine race/ethnicity discrimination in mortgage lending using Boston Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) data. Used R for data cleansing, and analysis of summary statistics, correlation matrix, odds ratio, marginal probability, log-likelihood, and chi-square values to predict discrimination on mortgage loan approval rates.

## Research question:
Controlling for relevant characteristics, is race/ethnicity associated with the outcome of a mortgage loan application?

## Data:
In 1990, following the request of the Federal Reserve Board of Boston, lending institutions in the Boston area provided additional information relevant to mortgage lending decisions.  In light of the relatively small number of mortgage loan applications made by minorities, these extra variables were collected for all applications by blacks and Hispanics and for a random sample of those by whites.
